To install, drag and drop the .tar.gz file into GNOME's Appearance Preferences,
or extract it and copy the gnome-* folders to /usr/share/icons as administrator
(i.e. sudo nautilus /usr/share/icons in Ubuntu).

You may also use the included makefile for system-wide installation, just type
"make install" as administrator or "make user-install" for per-user
installation. For more options, type "make help".

GNOME-Colors depends on the package "gnome-icon-theme". This package is already
installed in almost all distributions with a GNOME desktop environment, but you
may have to install this package if your distribution or desktop environment
does not have it by default. 

For more icon customization and features, you can install the GNOME-Colors
Extras. They are available in the project page as the "extras-gnome-colors"
package.

An extra "tan" color variation is available at the project page, it depends on
gnome-brave being installed and makes the icon set look more like the default
gnome-icon-theme. The package is called "extras-gnome-tribute"

If installed through the Appearance Preferences tool in Ubuntu (instead of
extracting /usr/share/icons), for icons to theme root/admin applications, you
must type in a terminal: sudo ln -s ~/.icons /root

Please read the "Authors" and "Copying" files!

It's always best to remove a previous version before upgrading!

Enjoy!
