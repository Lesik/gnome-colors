INSTALLATION:      #
####################
This section refers only to the distributable package. For theme creation, skip
to the next section.

To install, drag and drop the .tar.gz file into GNOME's Appearance Preferences,
or extract it and copy the gnome-* folders to /usr/share/icons as administrator
(i.e. sudo nautilus /usr/share/icons in Ubuntu). The gnome-colors-common folder
is a required dependency. You MUST install it in order for all the icon sets to
work correctly. If you install in this manner, it is VERY recommended to always
remove a previous version before installation.

You may also use the included Makefile for system-wide installation, just type
"make install" as administrator or "make user-install" for per-user
installation. For more options, type "make help". These commands should be run
within the extracted folder that contains the Makefile.

GNOME-Colors depends on the package "gnome-icon-theme". This package is already
installed in almost all distributions with a GNOME desktop environment, but you
may have to install this package if your distribution or desktop environment
does not have it by default. 

For more icon customization and features, you can install the GNOME-Colors
Extras. They are available in the project page as the "extras-gnome-colors"
package.

An extra "tan" color variation is available at the project page, it depends on
gnome-brave being installed and makes the icon set look more like the default
gnome-icon-theme. The package is called "extras-gnome-tribute"

If installed through the Appearance Preferences tool in Ubuntu (instead of
extracting /usr/share/icons), for icons to theme root/admin applications, you
must type in a terminal: sudo ln -s ~/.icons /root

Please read the "Authors" and "Copying" files!

THEME CREATION:    #
####################
This section refers only to the sources package. The sources package can be
downloaded separately from the distributable package.

GNOME-Colors supports complete, scripted recoloring and the creation of new
color variations automatically. To create a custom version of gnome-colors, just
follow the following instructions:

1. You need Inkscape. and ImageMagick. They are required dependencies for
   building gnome-colors from source.
2. Browse to the /themes folder and make a copy of any of the existing files.
3. Rename the copied file to "custom" or anything you like (no spaces!).
4. Open said file in a text editor, and change the name/values to your liking.
5. Run "make install-custom" as administrator or "make user-install-custom" to
   install per-user, where "custom" is the name of the icon set and theme file.
6. That's it! You now have a complete, custom gnome-colors variation installed
   into your system.

NOTE: The make process will take anywhere between a few minutes to a very long
      time depending on your system specs. If you own a dual-core pc, you can
      run "make install -j3" for the best performance. Tri-core processors would
      use "-j4" and so on...
