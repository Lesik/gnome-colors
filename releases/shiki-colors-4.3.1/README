To install, drag and drop the .tar.gz file into GNOME's Appearance Preferences, or extract it and copy the Shiki-* folders to /usr/share/icons as administrator (i.e. sudo nautilus /usr/share/themes in Ubuntu).

You may also use the included makefile for system-wide installation, just type "make install" as administrator or "make user-install" for per-user installation. For more options, type "make help".

There are a alternate/optional versions of the metacity (window borders) included.

For full Firefox 3.0+ compatibility, you may install the included userChrome.css file by copying it into your ~/.mozilla/firefox/(your profile directory)/chrome/ folder. Alternately, you can install the "Stylish" add-on, and go to http://userstyles.org/styles/10822 and load the userstyle. Using the Stylish add-on is recommended, as it is much easier and it will automatically update any changes. The userChrome file is non-invasive, and you won't notice any difference when using other themes, in fact, it may even fix Firefox 3.0+ in similar themes.

You can change the color scheme of a theme in GNOME's appearance preferences, by selecting customize and then the "Colors" tab. I recommend changing only the "Selected background" square for a custom colorscheme, but feel free to go wild and make the theme your own. Use the included tango color palette for some good color choices.

You can also customize any theme further by editing its /gtk-2.0/gtkrc file. There are line-by line instructions inside the file to help you achieve any look or maybe even teach you a thing or two about GTK themes.

You can edit the included panel.rc file to customize panel backgrounds to your liking.

The transparent wallpaper will adjust to any background color, but darker colors will look better than lighter ones.

This theme is heavily influenced clearlooks/ubuntu artwork, so really most of the credit should go to those projects.

You should use the GNOME-Colors icons with this theme.
