To install, drag and drop the gnome-****.tar.gz files into GNOME's appearance preferences, or extract them and copy their folders to /usr/share/icons as administrator (i.e. sudo nautilus /usr/share/icons in Ubuntu).

GNOME-Colors depends on the package "gnome-icon-theme". This package is already installed in almost all distributions with a GNOME desktop environment, but you may have to install this package if your distribution or desktop environment does not have it by default. 

For more icon customization and features, you can install the GNOME-Colors Extras. They are available in the project page as the "extras-gnome-colors" package.

If installed through the Appearance Preferences tool in Ubuntu (instead of extracting /usr/share/icons), for icons to theme root/admin applications, you must type in a terminal: sudo ln -s ~/.icons /root

Please read the "Authors" and "Copying" files!

It's always best to remove a previous version before upgrading!

Enjoy!
